This assignment was basically an ethical web scraping project. We extracted the relevant information from a website
and collected data to be analysed. Everything was done ethically and legally, respecting the terms of service
of the targeted sites. The site we worked with is called refdlagdeals.com. 

We started by creating a main menu then created all the required functions. We first displayed all the latest deals,
then created a function to analyse the deals by category, then displayed the top n stores that the user wish to see,
we also had an option to log deal information, and finally an exit option to the program.

The most challenging part of this assignment I felt was the fact that everything had to be indented correctly and that
the format was supposed to be very neat. And since Python is new to me, scraping information was a bit challenging.
